        A paragraph typically begins with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea.
        This is followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on the topic, providing details,
        examples, or explanations. Finally, a concluding sentence wraps up the discussion,
        summarizing the main point or providing a transition to the next paragraph.
